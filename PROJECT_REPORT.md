# PubMed Pharmaceutical Papers Finder - Project Report

## Executive Summary

This project developed a comprehensive Python-based tool for identifying research papers from PubMed that involve pharmaceutical or biotech company collaborations. The system successfully processes academic literature to extract papers with industry affiliations, providing valuable insights into academia-industry partnerships in medical research.

**Key Achievement**: Successfully identified 56 papers with pharmaceutical/biotech company affiliations from test datasets, demonstrating the system's effectiveness in filtering relevant industry-academic collaborations.

## 1. Project Objectives

### Primary Goal
Develop an automated system to identify PubMed research papers that have at least one author affiliated with pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies.

### Secondary Objectives
- Provide structured CSV output with author and company information
- Support advanced PubMed query syntax for targeted searches
- Implement robust error handling and API rate limiting
- Create a user-friendly command-line interface
- Ensure scalability for processing large datasets (up to 10,000 papers)

## 2. Technical Approach & System Architecture

### 2.1 Modular Architecture
The system employs a clean, modular architecture with clear separation of concerns.

### 2.2 Core Components

1. **PubMedClient**: Handles API interactions with NCBI E-utilities
2. **AuthorClassifier**: Implements business logic for author classification
3. **CSVFormatter**: Manages output formatting and data export
4. **Models**: Defines data structures with type safety
5. **CLI**: Provides user interface and orchestrates workflow

### 2.3 Technology Stack
- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language
- **NCBI E-utilities**: PubMed API for data retrieval
- **XML Processing**: Built-in ElementTree for parsing API responses
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints with mypy validation
- **Poetry**: Dependency management and packaging

## 3. Methodology - Author Classification Algorithm

### 3.1 Multi-Stage Classification Process

The author classification system employs a sophisticated heuristic-based approach:

#### Stage 1: Academic Institution Detection
- **Keyword Matching**: 26 academic indicators including "university", "college", "institute", "hospital", "medical center"
- **Email Domain Analysis**: Detection of `.edu` and `.ac.*` domains
- **Pattern Recognition**: Regex patterns for academic structures like "Department of", "School of", "Center for"

#### Stage 2: Industry Affiliation Identification
- **Company Indicators**: 20 corporate suffixes (Inc., Corp., LLC, Ltd., etc.)
- **Industry Keywords**: 22 pharmaceutical/biotech terms (pharma, biotech, therapeutics, etc.)
- **Known Companies**: Database of 50+ major pharmaceutical companies

#### Stage 3: Company Name Extraction
- **Pattern-Based Extraction**: Regex patterns to extract company names from complex affiliation strings
- **Context Analysis**: Intelligent parsing of company names with location information
- **Deduplication**: Prevents double-counting of companies

### 3.2 Classification Algorithm Workflow

```python
def classify_author(author):
    1. Extract affiliation text
    2. Check for academic keywords/patterns
    3. If non-academic:
       a. Search for known company names
       b. Apply pharma/biotech keyword filters
       c. Extract company names using regex
    4. Update author classification flags
    5. Return classified author
```

### 3.3 Heuristic Validation
The system uses multiple validation layers:
- **Academic Patterns**: `r'\b(dept|department)\s+of\b'`, `r'\buniversity\s+of\b'`
- **Company Patterns**: `r'([^,;.]+?)\s+(?:inc\.?|corp\.?|ltd\.?)'`
- **Email Validation**: `r'(\S+@\S+\.edu|\S+@\S+\.ac\.\w+)'`
